##fairouz- december 26,2023
-I edited the section naming a bit 
-we still had NAs, which i removed for both movie and show
-I had to remove all non-numerical features including the factor feature (age_certification), 
in order to draw the correlation matrix
-In the metrix, i was surprised to see that votes and imdb scores were not very correlated unlike our initial assumptions
(which we can note in the presentation), there was some correlation between genres that tend to exist together eg crime and thriller...
-scaling did not affect correlation
-I still have doubts concerning age certification and maybe we can look up the meaning and change them to interger levels 
-I don't know if we are gonna scale all columns but when i used min-max scale on votes the vlues were too small since the max and min value of votes
 are pretty far from each other(2294231 and 5), so maybe we can use a custom scale to stay within 1 and 10 like the imdb scores
-i did the scaling on the numerical dataframe, we can apply it to the original df after we decide on the factor features (including the ones with no certification)


# Meeting december 28, 2023
TODO's:
- new category for 'NAs' in age certification

Ideas: 
- mixture of Lasso and ridge, ridge for genre, Elastic Net (Mattia) (Comparisons, why does one work better than the others?)
- LOESS (Fairouz), PCA and k-means, Random Forest (Louis)
- Linear Model as starting point, maybe GLM as improvement (Theresa)
- Scaling: try models with both scaled and unscaled features, only scale imdb votes, or scale everthing

Notes:
- use same seed for every model
- models with or without tmdb score? Louis did some tests, no big difference for MSE





#fairouz, jan 1, 2024
-I tried scaling for svr, didn't help much even though svr can be sensitive to scaling(I avoided scaling the target so i can compare it with unscaled)
-I noticed svr was not predicting low scores at all, my theory is that we don't have enough data points with low scores
 and those with low scores have few votings (check mattia's graph) 
-do we consider these points as outliers?
-i got less mse with tmdb by 0.2-0.3

To do on jan2 :
-go over the models 
-write down layout for paper (sections)
-choose template for power point and divide work
-decide on next meeting 


#meeting on january 1,2024

progress:
-we have 4 models in total: SVR, random forest, ridge and elastic net 

ideas:
-we can mention using: scaling and no scaling  with tmdb and no tmdb 
but as a  summary table, we can use without tmdb (without score and popularity) and with scaling (not the target), movies 
-for presentation and paper:
	-introduction: the main goal of our project ...louis
	-dataset: explain the distribustion of our data, include some graphs...mattia
	-data pre-processing: remove NAs, remove unique values, hot encoding for genre, categorical age certification to factor, scaling ...fairouz and theresa 
	-correlation: include the matrices and briefly explain relations observed ...fairouz
	-models: train,test split briefly explain model motivation, formation, parameters ...each his own
	-results, observations (mention what extra stuff we did): in a table...theresa
	-further considerations...together

TO DO:
-each send on group by tomorrow morning: choose the movies that we wanna use for "beat the model" game and don't include in  training set
-each start writing his/her part in the presentation and paper 
-theresa: send link for overleaf
-For fairouz: write a explanation for the parameters used
-thursday jan 4 at 11 


january 3,2024
reminders:
-mention in the models section before talking about any of the models, the dataset we chose to use
ie say that we studied our models' performances with tmdb and without, with scaling and without o movies and shows,
but we cose to report the results with scaling without tmdb as a primary study  
the full results can be accessed on the github page (add link) 
-ask theresa what features she scaled so we all apply the same scaling




Meeting on january 4, 2024

Tasks:
-for louis: you can add something small for PCA( readon why you think it doesn't perform well)
-add final model in model file where we only include with scaling without tmbd 
-add a note about the archive on the report 
-mention in the models section before talking about any of the models, the dataset we chose to use
ie say that we studied our models' performances with tmdb and without, with scaling and without o movies and shows,
but we cose to report the results with scaling without tmdb as a primary study  
the full results can be accessed on the github page (add link) 
-also add test train split

TO DO: 
-proof-read the paper 
-decide on a movie for game
-formalize game 
-decide on format for power point 
-next meeting?

new remarks:
-NAs should be removed after we remove unique character features but not before removing tmdb sice in the full study we are studying with and without tmdb
-in data prep, after mutating data raw, we should omit NAs so that we don't get warnings in plotting
