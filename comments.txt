-I edited the section naming a bit 
-we still had NAs, which i removed for both movie and show
-I had to remove all non-numerical features including the factor feature (age_certification), 
in order to draw the correlation matrix
-In the metrix, i was surprised to see that votes and imdb scores were not very correlated unlike our initial assumptions
(which we can note in the presentation), there was some correlation between genres that tend to exist together eg crime and thriller...
-scaling did not affect correlation
-I still have doubts concerning age certification and maybe we can look up the meaning and change them to interger levels 
-I don't know if we are gonna scale all columns but when i used min-max scale on votes the vlues were too small since the max and min value of votes
 are pretty far from each other(2294231 and 5), so maybe we can use a custom scale to stay within 1 and 10 like the imdb scores
-i did the scaling on the numerical dataframe, we can apply it to the original df after we decide on the factor features (including the ones with no certification)
